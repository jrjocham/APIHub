With the `create_calendar_event` method implemented, our next step is to tackle `upload_drive_file`. We will need to use the Google Drive API to upload a file. The API requires us to send a POST request to `https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v3/files` with the file metadata and contents in the request body. Let's start by implementing the file metadata construction. We'll need to figure out how to handle file contents afterward.
```python
def upload_drive_file(self, file_name, file_contents):
file_metadata = {
"name": file_name,
"mimeType": "*/*" # Set MIME type to wildcard for automatic detection
}
# TO DO: Figure out how to handle file contents

def upload_drive_file(self, file_name, file_contents):
encoded_contents = base64.b64encode(bytes(file_contents, 'utf-8')).decode('utf-8')
file_metadata = {
"name": file_name,
"mimeType": "*/*", # Set MIME type to wildcard for automatic detection
}
# Construct the POST request body
body = {
'metadata': file_metadata,
'media': {'mimeType': file_metadata['mimeType'], 'body': encoded_contents}
}
# Make the POST request to upload the file
response = self.service.files().create(body=body).execute()
return response.get('id') # Return the ID of the newly uploaded file
